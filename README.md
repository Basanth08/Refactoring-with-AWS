## üöÄ Project Objectives

Our mission is to:
- Build flexible, scalable infrastructure with no upfront costs
- Embrace Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for repeatable, reliable deployments
- Leverage Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) for agility
- Modernize legacy systems for the cloud era

---

## üåê Real-World Scenario

Imagine a project whose services run across physical, virtual, and cloud machines. These services might include:
- DNS, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Node.js, Windows Server, Apache Tomcat, LAMP stack, Java, NGINX, and more

Multiple teams‚ÄîCloud, Virtualization, Data Center Ops, Monitoring, and Sys Admins‚Äîwork together to keep everything running smoothly.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Challenge

Traditional setups face several hurdles:
- High operational overhead
- Difficulty maintaining uptime and scaling
- Significant upfront (CapEx) and ongoing (OpEx) costs
- Manual processes that are hard to automate

---

## üí° The Solution: Cloud Setup

By moving to AWS, we unlock:
- **Automation**: Streamline deployments and management
- **PaaS & SaaS**: Focus on building, not maintaining infrastructure
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Version-controlled, repeatable environments
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Only pay for what you use
- **Flexibility**: Scale up or down as needed

All of this leads to easier, more efficient infrastructure management.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è AWS Services in Action

We use a suite of AWS services to replace and enhance traditional components:
- **Elastic Beanstalk**: Hosts Tomcat app servers, replaces NGINX load balancers, and automates VM scaling
- **S3/EFS**: Provides reliable, scalable storage
- **RDS**: Managed databases
- **Elastic Cache**: High-speed caching (Memcached/Redis)
- **Active MQ**: Managed message brokering
- **Route53**: Scalable DNS
- **CloudFront**: Global content delivery

All infrastructure is managed seamlessly in the AWS Cloud.

### üõ†Ô∏è Initializing the Application Database

After setting up your EC2 instance and RDS MySQL database, follow these steps to initialize your application database:

1. **Install the MySQL client:**
   ```sh
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install mysql-client -y
   ```
2. **Connect to your RDS MySQL instance:**
   ```sh
   mysql -h vprofile-rds-mysql.cs9642s4ahrr.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u admin -p
   ```
   - Enter your password when prompted.
   - You should see the MySQL monitor welcome message.

3. **Clone the vProfile project repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/devopshydclub/vprofile-project.git
   cd vprofile-project/
   ```
   - Verify the presence of the database backup file:
     ```sh
     ls src/main/resources/db_backup.sql
     ```

4. **Restore the database backup into your RDS instance:**
   ```sh
   mysql -h vprofile-rds-mysql.cs9642s4ahrr.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u admin -p accounts < src/main/resources/db_backup.sql
   ```
   - This will populate your database with the required tables and data.

5. **Verify the restoration:**
   ```sh
   mysql -h vprofile-rds-mysql.cs9642s4ahrr.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u admin -p accounts
   show tables;
   ```
   - You should see tables like `role`, `user`, and `user_role`.

These steps ensure your application database is ready for use with the vProfile project.

### üõ†Ô∏è Connecting to the RDS MySQL Database

After launching your EC2 instance and installing the MySQL client, you can connect to your Amazon RDS MySQL database as follows:

1. **Install the MySQL client:**
   ```sh
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install mysql-client -y
   ```
2. **Connect to the RDS instance:**
   ```sh
   mysql -h vprofile-rds-mysql.cs9642s4ahrr.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u Admin -p
   ```
   When prompted, enter your database password.

   - **Endpoint:** vprofile-rds-mysql.cs9642s4ahrr.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
   - **Username:** Admin
   - **Password:** (use your secure password)

> **Note:** Never share your database password publicly. Store credentials securely using environment variables or AWS Secrets Manager in production environments.

### üîê Creating an IAM Role for Elastic Beanstalk

To enable your Elastic Beanstalk application to interact securely with other AWS services, you created an IAM role and attached the following AWS managed policies:

- **AdministratorAccess-AWSElasticBeanstalk**
- **AWSElasticBeanstalkCustomPlatformforEC2Role**
- **AWSElasticBeanstalkRoleSNS**
- **AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier**

These policies grant the necessary permissions for Elastic Beanstalk to manage environments, interact with EC2 instances, send notifications, and perform other essential operations.

> **Tip:** Always follow the principle of least privilege. Attach only the permissions your application needs for security best practices.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuring application.properties

After setting up your AWS resources and database, update the `application.properties` file in your vProfile project with the required credentials and connection details. This typically includes:

- RDS MySQL endpoint, username, and password
- ElastiCache (Memcached) endpoint
- RabbitMQ (Amazon MQ) endpoint and credentials
- Any other AWS resource endpoints or secrets needed by the application

**Example:**
```properties
# Database
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://<RDS-ENDPOINT>:3306/accounts
spring.datasource.username=<DB-USERNAME>
spring.datasource.password=<DB-PASSWORD>

# Memcached
memcached.servers=<ELASTICACHE-ENDPOINT>:11211

# RabbitMQ
rabbitmq.host=<MQ-ENDPOINT>
rabbitmq.username=<MQ-USERNAME>
rabbitmq.password=<MQ-PASSWORD>
```
> **Tip:** Never commit sensitive credentials to version control. Use environment variables or AWS Secrets Manager for production deployments.

This step ensures your application can connect to all required AWS services and function correctly in the cloud environment.
