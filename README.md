# Refactoring with AWS

Welcome to the **Refactoring with AWS** project! This repository is your guide to transforming traditional, complex infrastructures into modern, scalable, and cost-effective cloud-native solutions using Amazon Web Services. Whether you're a developer, architect, or cloud enthusiast, you'll find practical insights and hands-on examples to help you on your cloud journey.

## üöÄ Project Objectives

Our mission is to:
- Build flexible, scalable infrastructure with no upfront costs
- Embrace Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for repeatable, reliable deployments
- Leverage Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) for agility
- Modernize legacy systems for the cloud era

---

## üåê Real-World Scenario

Imagine a project whose services run across physical, virtual, and cloud machines. These services might include:
- DNS, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Node.js, Windows Server, Apache Tomcat, LAMP stack, Java, NGINX, and more

Multiple teams‚ÄîCloud, Virtualization, Data Center Ops, Monitoring, and Sys Admins‚Äîwork together to keep everything running smoothly.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Challenge

Traditional setups face several hurdles:
- High operational overhead
- Difficulty maintaining uptime and scaling
- Significant upfront (CapEx) and ongoing (OpEx) costs
- Manual processes that are hard to automate

---

## üí° The Solution: Cloud Setup

By moving to AWS, we unlock:
- **Automation**: Streamline deployments and management
- **PaaS & SaaS**: Focus on building, not maintaining infrastructure
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Version-controlled, repeatable environments
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Only pay for what you use
- **Flexibility**: Scale up or down as needed

All of this leads to easier, more efficient infrastructure management.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è AWS Services in Action

We use a suite of AWS services to replace and enhance traditional components:
- **Elastic Beanstalk**: Hosts Tomcat app servers, replaces NGINX load balancers, and automates VM scaling
- **S3/EFS**: Provides reliable, scalable storage
- **RDS**: Managed databases
- **Elastic Cache**: High-speed caching (Memcached/Redis)
- **Active MQ**: Managed message brokering
- **Route53**: Scalable DNS
- **CloudFront**: Global content delivery

All infrastructure is managed seamlessly in the AWS Cloud.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

![AWS Architecture Diagram](./Diagrams/architecture.png)

The diagram above shows how users access the application through Route 53 and CloudFront, with traffic managed by an Application Load Balancer and Elastic Beanstalk (running Tomcat). Supporting services like RDS, Memcached, Amazon MQ, and S3 ensure the application is scalable, resilient, and cloud-native.

### Key Components
- **EC2 Instances**: Scalable compute for your applications
- **ELB**: Distributes traffic for high availability
- **Autoscaling**: Dynamically adjusts resources
- **EFS/S3**: Shared and object storage
- **RDS**: Managed relational databases
- **Elastic Cache**: In-memory caching
- **Active MQ**: Message brokering
- **Route53**: DNS management
- **CloudFront**: Content delivery network

This architecture delivers high availability, scalability, and performance for modern applications.

## üîÑ AWS vs. Traditional Infrastructure

| AWS Service         | Traditional Equivalent           |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| Beanstalk           | Tomcat EC2/VM                    |
| ELB in Beanstalk    | NGINX LB/ELB                     |
| Autoscaling         | None / Manual Scaling             |
| EFS/S3              | NFS / S3 / EFS                    |
| RDS                 | MySQL on VM/EC2                  |
| Elastic Cache       | Memcached on VM/EC2              |
| Active MQ           | RabbitMQ on VM/EC2               |
| Route53             | GoDaddy, Local DNS               |
| CloudFront          | None / Multi DC across world      |

AWS services not only replace but also enhance traditional infrastructure, offering automation, scalability, and global reach.

## üìö About This Project

- Multi-tier web application stack ([VPROFILE] example)
- Refactored and re-architected for AWS Cloud
- Designed to boost agility and business continuity

---

## üìñ Project Overview

This repository demonstrates best practices for refactoring and modernizing applications using AWS. You'll find:
- Real-world refactoring examples
- Integration with AWS services (Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, and more)
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates
- CI/CD pipeline blueprints
- Cost optimization strategies

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd "Refactoring with AWS"
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   - Python 3.8+ and/or Node.js (if applicable)
   - Install required packages as specified in each module
3. **Configure AWS credentials:**
   - Set up your AWS CLI with `aws configure`
   - Ensure your IAM user has the necessary permissions

## üìù Flow of Execution

Here's a step-by-step guide to how the AWS environment is set up and deployed for this project:

**üîë Key Pair Created:**
- Name: `vprofile-bean-key`
- Type: `rsa`
- Created: 2025/07/06 12:17 GMT-4

This key pair is used for secure login to your Beanstalk instances.

1. **Login to your AWS account**
2. **Create a key pair** for Beanstalk instance login (e.g., `vprofile-bean-key`)
3. **Create security groups** for ElastiCache, RDS, and ActiveMQ
4. **Provision core AWS services:**
    - RDS (Relational Database Service)
    - Amazon ElastiCache
    - Amazon ActiveMQ
5. **Create an Elastic Beanstalk environment**
6. **Update security groups** of backend resources to:
    - Allow traffic from the Beanstalk security group
    - Allow internal traffic as needed
7. **Launch an EC2 instance** for database initialization
8. **Login to the EC2 instance** and initialize the RDS database
9. **Adjust Beanstalk health checks** (e.g., set to `/login`)
10. **Add an HTTPS (443) listener** to the Elastic Load Balancer
11. **Build your application artifact** with backend information
12. **Deploy the artifact** to Elastic Beanstalk
13. **Create a CDN (CloudFront) with SSL certificate**
14. **Update DNS entries** (e.g., in GoDaddy DNS zones) to point to your AWS resources

This flow ensures a secure, scalable, and production-ready deployment on AWS.

### üîí Security Group: vprofile-backend-SG

- **Security group name:** vprofile-backend-SG
- **Description:** Security group for backend services
- **VPC ID:** vpc-04b1261bc49c7c0f8
- **Inbound rules:**
  - SSH (TCP, port 22) from allowed sources
  - All traffic (all protocols, all ports) from allowed sources
- **Outbound rules:**
  - Default (allow all)

This security group is essential for controlling access to backend resources such as EC2 instances, RDS, ElastiCache, and ActiveMQ. It ensures only authorized traffic can reach your backend services, improving the security posture of your AWS environment.
